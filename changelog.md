# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Python SDK Parity**: Implemented the `search_events` method in the Python SDK, bringing it to full parity with the TypeScript implementation introduced in v1.3.1.
- **UnifiedEvent Model**: Added the native `UnifiedEvent` dataclass to the Python SDK for better type safety when using hierarchical search.
- **Semantic Aliases**: Added a `.question` property alias to `UnifiedMarket` in the Python SDK, matching common developer expectations for prediction market queries.

### Fixed
- **Python SDK API Calls**: Fixed a regression where hierarchical search endpoints were missing from the auto-generated internal API client by implementing a robust manual fallback.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Python SDK Bundled Server**: Updated the internal bundled sidecar server to the latest version. This resolves a regression where the "Date Handling in OHLCV" fix (from v1.1.3) was not correctly applied in the Python distribution, causing `getTime is not a function` errors when fetching historical data.

### Improved
- **CI/CD**: Added an automated step to the GitHub Actions workflow to rebuild and bundle the sidecar server immediately before publishing the Python package, ensuring the PyPI distribution always contains the latest core server code.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Hierarchical Search API**: Introduced a new, cleaner way to discover markets via the `searchEvents` method.
  - **Contextual Grouping**: `searchEvents` returns `UnifiedEvent` objects that group related markets (e.g., all candidates in the same election).
  - **In-Event Search**: Added `event.searchMarkets(query)` to result objects for fast, contextual filtering.
  - **Unified Support**: Implemented for both Polymarket (Gamma API) and Kalshi (Events API).
- **OpenAPI Updates**: Exposed the new `/searchEvents` endpoint and `UnifiedEvent` schema in the sidecar server documentation.

### Improved
- **Developer Experience (DX)**: Updated the README Quickstart to prioritize the new hierarchical search pattern, reducing boilerplate for common tasks.
- **Documentation**: Simplified the main README for both Python and TypeScript, clearly explaining the **Event -> Market -> Outcome** data hierarchy.
- **Build Infrastructure**: Hardened `verify-all.sh` to handle monorepo version mismatches more gracefully during local development by making `npm install` conditional.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Unified Semantic Shortcuts**: Introduced convenience properties for binary markets across all SDKs (Python and TypeScript).
  - **New Properties**: `market.yes`, `market.no`, `market.up`, and `market.down`.
  - **Intelligent Mapping**: Implemented shared core logic to automatically identify "Yes" vs "No" outcomes based on labels and common patterns (e.g., "Not X" pairs).
  - **Expressive Aliases**: Added `.up` and `.down` as semantic aliases for `.yes` and `.no` to improve readability for directional markets.

### Improved
- **Core Architecture**: Extracted market normalization logic into a shared utility to ensure absolute parity between exchange implementations.
- **SDK Parity**: Updated both auto-generated and handcrafted portions of the Python and TypeScript SDKs to expose the new fields with full type hinting.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Timezone Handling**: Hardened date parsing to treat naive ISO strings (typically from Python's `datetime.utcnow()`) as UTC. This prevents timezone shifts when querying historical data across the sidecar interface.

### Improved
- **Polymarket OHLCV**: Implemented robust client-side candle aggregation for Polymarket price history.
  - Previously: The endpoint returned raw trade/tick data points which could be noisy or misaligned.
  - Now: Data is properly bucketed into time intervals (candles) with accurate Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume calculations.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Date Handling in OHLCV**: Fixed a critical issue where the Python SDK (which serializes datetime objects as strings) was causing "getTime is not a function" errors in the TypeScript sidecar.
  - Implemented robust date parsing middleware in `fetchOHLCV` for both Polymarket and Kalshi exchanges.
  - The sidecar server now correctly accepts both native `Date` objects (from internal TS calls) and ISO 8601 strings (from external APIs/SDKs) for `start` and `end` parameters.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Server Lifecycle**: Resolved a critical race condition where multiple concurrent client instantiations (e.g., initializing both Polymarket and Kalshi simultaneously) would kill and restart the sidecar server, invalidating access tokens.
- **Version Detection**: Improved `package.json` discovery in the sidecar server to ensure correct version reporting in bundled environments.
- **SDK Stability**: Updated the Python `ServerManager` to be more tolerant of version suffixes (like `-b4` or `-dev`), preventing unnecessary server restarts during development.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Unified WebSocket Support**: Introduced real-time streaming capabilities for prediction markets via a standardized interface.
  - **New Methods**: Added `watchOrderBook(id)` and `watchTrades(id)` following the CCXT Pro pattern for real-time data ingestion.
  - **Kalshi WebSocket**: Implemented native WebSocket support for Kalshi, including real-time order book snapshots, incremental deltas, and trade feeds.
  - **Polymarket CLOB WebSocket**: Integrated with Polymarket's Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) WebSocket for low-latency market updates.
  - **Sidecar Integration**: Real-time methods are now accessible via the sidecar server, enabling streaming support across Python and TypeScript SDKs.
- **Examples**: Added comprehensive WebSocket examples in `examples/market-data/`:
  - `watch_orderbook_kalshi.ts` / `watch_orderbook_polymarket.ts`
  - `watch_trades_kalshi.ts` / `watch_trades_polymarket.ts`

### Changed
- **Data Normalization**: Enhanced market ID resolution to ensure consistency between REST snapshots and WebSocket update streams.
- **Kalshi Order Book Logic**: Optimized the internal book builder to automatically handle Kalshi's "bids-only" data format by synthesizing asks from inverse outcomes.

### Fixed
- **Build Infrastructure**: Resolved "missing dependency" errors by adding `ws` and `@types/ws` to the core package.
- **Connection Stability**: Improved WebSocket reconnection logic and error handling to manage network disruptions gracefully.
- **Type Definitions**: Fixed several edge-case TypeScript errors in WebSocket event handlers.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Sidecar Security**: Implemented a secure handshake protocol between the SDK and the Node.js sidecar server to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Auto-Restart Handshake**: Added logic to automatically detect sidecar crashes and restart the process seamlessly.

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Pagination**: Fixed a critical bug in `fetchMarkets` where the `offset` parameter was incorrectly ignored, enabling full traversal of Kalshi's market catalog.
- **Metadata Management**: Improved reliability of internal metadata enrichment for Polymarket results.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Zero-Config SDK Installation**: The sidecar server (`pmxt-core`) is now bundled directly within the SDK distributions, enabling a single-command setup experience.
  - **Python**: Bundled the server logic into the `pmxt` package on PyPI.
  - **TypeScript**: Added `pmxt-core` as a direct dependency for `pmxtjs`.
- **Project Statistics**: Introduced a programmatic "Total Downloads" badge in the README that aggregates data from both npm and PyPI.
- **Automation**: Implemented a GitHub Action to automatically update repository statistics and download counts.

### Changed
- **Branding**: Switched to a unified "version" badge in the documentation to reflect cross-platform consistency.
- **Server Discovery**: Updated the `pmxt-ensure-server` utility to intelligently detect bundled server locations in various environment types (venv, global, etc.).

### Fixed
- **Broken Documentation Links**: Resolved several dead links in the API Reference and Examples sections.
- **Installation Footprint**: Optimized the bundled server footprint for faster SDK installs.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-17

broken

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Core SDK (Universal)**: Implemented dynamic port detection via the `~/.pmxt/server.lock` file. This resolves `ConnectionRefusedError` issues when the default port (3847) is already in use and the server falls back to an alternative port.
- **TypeScript SDK**: Resolved a critical race condition where API calls could be executed before the internal server manager had finished starting the sidecar or detecting the actual running port. Standardized the initialization pattern using an internal `initPromise`.
- **TypeScript SDK**: Fixed `ServerManager` health checks to correctly target the dynamically detected port instead of always checking the default.
- **Python SDK**: Hardened the `ServerManager` logic and improved consistency with the TypeScript implementation.

### Added
- **Python**: Added `examples/test_port_detection.py` to demonstrate and verify the new dynamic port resolution logic.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-17

### Major Release: Multi-Language SDK Support

This release represents a complete architectural transformation of pmxt, introducing **multi-language support** through a unified sidecar architecture. The project has evolved from a TypeScript-only library to a comprehensive multi-language ecosystem with official Python and TypeScript SDKs.

### Breaking Changes

- **Monorepo Structure**: The project has been restructured into a monorepo with separate packages:
  - `pmxt-core`: Core Node.js server with aggregation logic
  - `pmxtjs`: TypeScript/JavaScript SDK (npm)
  - `pmxt`: Python SDK (PyPI)
- **Package Names**: The npm package remains `pmxtjs`, but the internal structure has changed significantly
- **Import Paths**: TypeScript SDK now uses a wrapper architecture with automatic server management

### Added

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
The new sidecar architecture works as follows:
1. **Core Server**: Node.js Express server (`pmxt-core`) runs locally and handles all exchange integrations
2. **SDK Clients**: Language-specific SDKs (Python, TypeScript) communicate with the core server via HTTP
3. **Auto-Management**: SDKs automatically start/stop the server as needed
4. **Type Safety**: OpenAPI specification ensures type consistency across all languages

#### Package Versions
- `pmxt-core`: 1.0.0
- `pmxtjs`: 1.0.0
- `pmxt` (Python): 1.0.0

#### Migration from v0.4.4
For TypeScript users:
```typescript
// v0.4.4 (still works)
import pmxt from 'pmxtjs';
const poly = new pmxt.Polymarket();

// v1.0.0 (same API, new architecture)
import pmxt from 'pmxtjs';
const poly = new pmxt.Polymarket();
```

For Python users (new):
```python
import pmxt

poly = pmxt.Polymarket()
markets = poly.search_markets("Trump")
```

### Known Limitations

- **Node.js Dependency**: Both SDKs require Node.js to be installed (for the sidecar server)
- **Beta Features**: Some advanced features are still in beta (see `BETA_RELEASE.md`)
- **Exchange Coverage**: Currently supports Polymarket and Kalshi (more exchanges planned for v1.x.x)

### Acknowledgments

This release represents a major milestone in making prediction market data accessible across all major programming languages. Special thanks to all contributors and early testers who helped shape this architecture.

---
 
## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **ESM Import Compatibility**: Fixed an issue where `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` in ES Module environments (e.g., Node.js with `"type": "module"`) would wrap the default export in an extra `.default` property, breaking the expected `pmxt.polymarket()` syntax. Added explicit named exports (`polymarket`, `kalshi`) to ensure proper CommonJS/ESM interoperability.

### Added
- **Named Exports**: You can now import exchanges directly using named imports: `import { polymarket, kalshi } from 'pmxtjs'` in addition to the default `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` syntax.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Zombie Files in `dist/`**: Implemented a `prebuild` step that automatically cleans the `dist/` folder before every build. This prevents "stuck on old code" issues on macOS/Windows caused by file-to-directory refactors (e.g., `Kalshi.js` becoming `kalshi/index.js`).

### Added
- **Automated Publishing**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and publish to npm whenever a new repository tag (e.g., `v0.4.3`) is pushed.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Description Field**: Corrected a mapping issue where the unified `description` field was being populated with `event.sub_title` or `market.subtitle` (which typically only contain dates). It now correctly uses `market.rules_primary`, providing the actual resolution criteria as intended.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Metadata Enrichment**: Fixed a major data gap where Kalshi markets were returning empty `tags`. 
  - **The Issue**: The Kalshi `/events` and `/markets` endpoints do not expose tags. Tags are instead nested under the `/series` metadata, which wasn't being queried.
  - **The Fix**: Implemented a secondary fetch layer that retrieves Series metadata and maps it back to Markets.
  - **Unified Tags**: Standardized the provider data model by merging Kalshi's `category` and `tags` into a single unified `tags` array, ensuring consistency with Polymarket's data structure.

### Changed
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Modified `fetchMarkets` to fetch Series mapping in parallel with events and `getMarketsBySlug` to perform atomic enrichment.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Trading Support**: Added full trading support for **Polymarket** and **Kalshi**, including:
  - Order management: `createOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `fetchOrder`, `fetchOpenOrders`.
  - Account management: `fetchBalance`, `fetchPositions`.
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests for all trading operations.
- **Examples**: Added new examples for trading and account data (e.g., `list_positions`).

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Refactored monolithic `Exchange` classes into modular files for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Simplified Polymarket authentication workflow.
- **Documentation**: Updated `API_REFERENCE.md` with detailed trading and account management methods.

### Fixed
- **Jest Configuration**: Resolved issues with ES modules in dependencies for testing.
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Fixed various bugs such as ticker formatting and signature generation.

### CRITICAL NOTES
- Polymarket has been tested manually, and works.
- Kalshi HAS NOT been tested manually but has been implemented according to the kalshi docs.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Search Scope Control**: Added `searchIn` parameter to `searchMarkets` allowing 'title' (default), 'description', or 'both'.

### Changed
- **Default Search Behavior**: `searchMarkets` now defaults to searching only titles to reduce noise and improve relevance.
- **Improved Search Coverage**: Increased search depth for both Polymarket and Kalshi to cover all active markets (up to 100,000) instead of just the top results.

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Updated README Quick Example to be robust against empty results.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **CCXT Syntax Alignment**: Renamed core methods to follow `ccxt` conventions:
  - `getMarkets` -> `fetchMarkets`
  - `getOrderBook` -> `fetchOrderBook`
  - `getTradeHistory` -> `fetchTrades`
  - `getMarketHistory` -> `fetchOHLCV`
- **Namespace Support**: Implemented `pmxt` default export to allow usage like `pmxt.polymarket`.

### Improved
- **Kalshi OHLCV**: Enhanced price mapping and added mid-price fallback for historical data.
- **Examples**: Updated `historical_prices.ts` to use new method names and improved logic.

### Fixed
- **Type Definitions**: Updated internal interfaces to match the new naming scheme.
- **Documentation**: Updated test headers and file references.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Test Suite**: Added missing `ts-jest` dependency to ensure tests run correctly.
- **Search Robustness**: Fixed a potential crash in `searchMarkets` for both Kalshi and Polymarket when handling markets with missing descriptions or titles.
- **Data Validation**: Added better error handling for JSON parsing in Polymarket outcomes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **Unified Deep-Dive Method IDs**: Standardized the IDs used in deep-dive methods across exchanges to ensure consistency. This changes the return signatures of data methods.

### Improved
- **Examples**: Simplified and fixed examples, including `historical_prices`, `orderbook_depth`, and `search_grouping`, to better demonstrate library usage.
- **Example Data**: Updated default queries in examples for more relevant results.

### Documentation
- **README Enhancements**: Added badges, platform logos, and a visual overview image to the README.
- **License**: Added MIT License to the project.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Changed
- **Cleaner Logs**: Removed verbose `console.log` statements from `KalshiExchange` and `PolymarketExchange` to ensure a quieter library experience.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Switched noisy data parsing warnings to silent failures or internal handling.
- **Repository Restructuring**: Flattened project structure for easier development and publishing.
- **readme.md**: Pushed readme.md to npmjs.org

### Removed
- `Fetched n pages from Kalshi...` logs.
- `Extracted n markets from k events.` logs.
- `Failed to parse outcomes` warnings in Polymarket.
