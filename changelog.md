## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **CCXT Syntax Alignment**: Renamed core methods to follow `ccxt` conventions:
  - `getMarkets` -> `fetchMarkets`
  - `getOrderBook` -> `fetchOrderBook`
  - `getTradeHistory` -> `fetchTrades`
  - `getMarketHistory` -> `fetchOHLCV`
- **Namespace Support**: Implemented `pmxt` default export to allow usage like `pmxt.polymarket`.

### Improved
- **Kalshi OHLCV**: Enhanced price mapping and added mid-price fallback for historical data.
- **Examples**: Updated `historical_prices.ts` to use new method names and improved logic.

### Fixed

- **Documentation**: Updated test headers and file references.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes

- **Repository Restructuring**: Flattened project structure for easier development and publishing.
- **readme.md**: Pushed readme.md to npmjs.org
