## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-17

### Major Release: Multi-Language SDK Support

This release represents a complete architectural transformation of pmxt, introducing **multi-language support** through a unified sidecar architecture. The project has evolved from a TypeScript-only library to a comprehensive multi-language ecosystem with official Python and TypeScript SDKs.

### Breaking Changes

- **Monorepo Structure**: The project has been restructured into a monorepo with separate packages:
  - `pmxt-core`: Core Node.js server with aggregation logic
  - `pmxtjs`: TypeScript/JavaScript SDK (npm)
  - `pmxt`: Python SDK (PyPI)
- **Package Names**: The npm package remains `pmxtjs`, but the internal structure has changed significantly
- **Import Paths**: TypeScript SDK now uses a wrapper architecture with automatic server management

### Added

#### Python SDK (`pmxt`)
- **Official Python Support**: First-class Python SDK with full feature parity with TypeScript
- **Automatic Server Management**: Python SDK automatically starts and manages the Node.js sidecar server
- **Native Python API**: Pythonic interface with type hints and async support
- **PyPI Distribution**: Published to PyPI as `pmxt` package
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Python examples for all major features (market data, trading, account management)
- **Auto-generated Documentation**: Language-specific API reference documentation

#### Sidecar Architecture
- **Local Express Server**: Core aggregation logic runs as a local HTTP server (port 3847)
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Complete OpenAPI 3.0 schema for all endpoints
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring and server lifecycle management
- **Automatic Startup**: SDKs automatically start the server when needed
- **Process Management**: Graceful shutdown and cleanup of background processes

#### Infrastructure & Automation
- **OpenAPI Code Generation**: Automated SDK generation from OpenAPI spec using `openapi-generator`
- **Multi-Language CI/CD**: Unified GitHub Actions workflow for publishing to both npm and PyPI
- **Automated Version Management**: Script-based version synchronization across all packages
- **Beta Release Pipeline**: Support for beta releases with dynamic npm tagging
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test suite verifying SDK-to-core compatibility
- **Automated Documentation**: Template-based API documentation generation for each language

#### Core Improvements
- **Per-Request Credentials**: Support for passing credentials on a per-request basis
- **Optimized Kalshi Fetching**: Improved performance for Kalshi market data retrieval
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript types for all data models
- **Schema Synchronization**: OpenAPI schema now fully synchronized with core TypeScript types

#### Documentation
- **Language-Specific Docs**: Separate API references for Python and TypeScript
- **Setup Guides**: Detailed setup instructions for both SDKs
- **Testing Guide**: Comprehensive testing documentation (`TESTING.md`)
- **Beta Release Guide**: Documentation for beta release process (`BETA_RELEASE.md`)
- **Contributing Guide**: Updated contribution guidelines for monorepo structure
- **Roadmap**: Updated roadmap reflecting v1.0.0 completion and future plans

### Changed

- **Repository Structure**: Migrated to monorepo with `core/`, `sdks/python/`, and `sdks/typescript/` directories
- **Build Process**: Separate build pipelines for each package with proper dependency management
- **Testing Strategy**: Multi-tier testing (unit, integration, SDK verification)
- **Version Management**: Centralized version management across all packages
- **Repository URLs**: Updated to `pmxt-dev/pmxt` organization for provenance verification
- **License Holder**: Updated copyright holder in LICENSE file

### Fixed

- **ESM/CJS Interoperability**: Implemented dual build (CommonJS/ESM) for TypeScript SDK
  - Fixed "double default" issue in ES Module environments
  - Added `.js` extensions to imports in ESM build
  - Proper `exports` field configuration in `package.json`
- **OpenAPI Schema Sync**: Resolved discrepancies between OpenAPI spec and core types
  - Added missing properties (`resolutionDate`, `metadata`, etc.)
  - Fixed enum types for `Order.status` and similar fields
  - Ensured all SDK-generated models match actual data structures
- **Python Versioning**: Implemented PEP 440 compliant version format for Python packages
- **Build Order Issues**: Resolved TypeScript SDK build dependencies and compilation order
- **Port Configuration**: Standardized on port 3847 with proper health check endpoints
- **CI Build Errors**: Fixed isolated TypeScript generation and build configuration issues

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
The new sidecar architecture works as follows:
1. **Core Server**: Node.js Express server (`pmxt-core`) runs locally and handles all exchange integrations
2. **SDK Clients**: Language-specific SDKs (Python, TypeScript) communicate with the core server via HTTP
3. **Auto-Management**: SDKs automatically start/stop the server as needed
4. **Type Safety**: OpenAPI specification ensures type consistency across all languages

#### Package Versions
- `pmxt-core`: 1.0.0
- `pmxtjs`: 1.0.0
- `pmxt` (Python): 1.0.0

#### Migration from v0.4.4
For TypeScript users:
```typescript
// v0.4.4 (still works)
import pmxt from 'pmxtjs';
const poly = new pmxt.Polymarket();

// v1.0.0 (same API, new architecture)
import pmxt from 'pmxtjs';
const poly = new pmxt.Polymarket();
```

For Python users (new):
```python
import pmxt

poly = pmxt.Polymarket()
markets = poly.search_markets("Trump")
```

### Known Limitations

- **Node.js Dependency**: Both SDKs require Node.js to be installed (for the sidecar server)
- **Beta Features**: Some advanced features are still in beta (see `BETA_RELEASE.md`)
- **Exchange Coverage**: Currently supports Polymarket and Kalshi (more exchanges planned for v1.x.x)

### Acknowledgments

This release represents a major milestone in making prediction market data accessible across all major programming languages. Special thanks to all contributors and early testers who helped shape this architecture.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **ESM Import Compatibility**: Fixed an issue where `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` in ES Module environments (e.g., Node.js with `"type": "module"`) would wrap the default export in an extra `.default` property, breaking the expected `pmxt.polymarket()` syntax. Added explicit named exports (`polymarket`, `kalshi`) to ensure proper CommonJS/ESM interoperability.

### Added
- **Named Exports**: You can now import exchanges directly using named imports: `import { polymarket, kalshi } from 'pmxtjs'` in addition to the default `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` syntax.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Zombie Files in `dist/`**: Implemented a `prebuild` step that automatically cleans the `dist/` folder before every build. This prevents "stuck on old code" issues on macOS/Windows caused by file-to-directory refactors (e.g., `Kalshi.js` becoming `kalshi/index.js`).

### Added
- **Automated Publishing**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and publish to npm whenever a new repository tag (e.g., `v0.4.3`) is pushed.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Description Field**: Corrected a mapping issue where the unified `description` field was being populated with `event.sub_title` or `market.subtitle` (which typically only contain dates). It now correctly uses `market.rules_primary`, providing the actual resolution criteria as intended.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Metadata Enrichment**: Fixed a major data gap where Kalshi markets were returning empty `tags`. 
  - **The Issue**: The Kalshi `/events` and `/markets` endpoints do not expose tags. Tags are instead nested under the `/series` metadata, which wasn't being queried.
  - **The Fix**: Implemented a secondary fetch layer that retrieves Series metadata and maps it back to Markets.
  - **Unified Tags**: Standardized the provider data model by merging Kalshi's `category` and `tags` into a single unified `tags` array, ensuring consistency with Polymarket's data structure.

### Changed
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Modified `fetchMarkets` to fetch Series mapping in parallel with events and `getMarketsBySlug` to perform atomic enrichment.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Trading Support**: Added full trading support for **Polymarket** and **Kalshi**, including:
  - Order management: `createOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `fetchOrder`, `fetchOpenOrders`.
  - Account management: `fetchBalance`, `fetchPositions`.
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests for all trading operations.
- **Examples**: Added new examples for trading and account data (e.g., `list_positions`).

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Refactored monolithic `Exchange` classes into modular files for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Simplified Polymarket authentication workflow.
- **Documentation**: Updated `API_REFERENCE.md` with detailed trading and account management methods.

### Fixed
- **Jest Configuration**: Resolved issues with ES modules in dependencies for testing.
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Fixed various bugs such as ticker formatting and signature generation.

### CRITICAL NOTES
- Polymarket has been tested manually, and works.
- Kalshi HAS NOT been tested manually but has been implemented according to the kalshi docs.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Search Scope Control**: Added `searchIn` parameter to `searchMarkets` allowing 'title' (default), 'description', or 'both'.

### Changed
- **Default Search Behavior**: `searchMarkets` now defaults to searching only titles to reduce noise and improve relevance.
- **Improved Search Coverage**: Increased search depth for both Polymarket and Kalshi to cover all active markets (up to 100,000) instead of just the top results.

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Updated README Quick Example to be robust against empty results.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **CCXT Syntax Alignment**: Renamed core methods to follow `ccxt` conventions:
  - `getMarkets` -> `fetchMarkets`
  - `getOrderBook` -> `fetchOrderBook`
  - `getTradeHistory` -> `fetchTrades`
  - `getMarketHistory` -> `fetchOHLCV`
- **Namespace Support**: Implemented `pmxt` default export to allow usage like `pmxt.polymarket`.

### Improved
- **Kalshi OHLCV**: Enhanced price mapping and added mid-price fallback for historical data.
- **Examples**: Updated `historical_prices.ts` to use new method names and improved logic.

### Fixed
- **Type Definitions**: Updated internal interfaces to match the new naming scheme.
- **Documentation**: Updated test headers and file references.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Test Suite**: Added missing `ts-jest` dependency to ensure tests run correctly.
- **Search Robustness**: Fixed a potential crash in `searchMarkets` for both Kalshi and Polymarket when handling markets with missing descriptions or titles.
- **Data Validation**: Added better error handling for JSON parsing in Polymarket outcomes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **Unified Deep-Dive Method IDs**: Standardized the IDs used in deep-dive methods across exchanges to ensure consistency. This changes the return signatures of data methods.

### Improved
- **Examples**: Simplified and fixed examples, including `historical_prices`, `orderbook_depth`, and `search_grouping`, to better demonstrate library usage.
- **Example Data**: Updated default queries in examples for more relevant results.

### Documentation
- **README Enhancements**: Added badges, platform logos, and a visual overview image to the README.
- **License**: Added MIT License to the project.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Changed
- **Cleaner Logs**: Removed verbose `console.log` statements from `KalshiExchange` and `PolymarketExchange` to ensure a quieter library experience.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Switched noisy data parsing warnings to silent failures or internal handling.
- **Repository Restructuring**: Flattened project structure for easier development and publishing.
- **readme.md**: Pushed readme.md to npmjs.org

### Removed
- `Fetched n pages from Kalshi...` logs.
- `Extracted n markets from k events.` logs.
- `Failed to parse outcomes` warnings in Polymarket.
